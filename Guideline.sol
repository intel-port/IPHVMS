 * What is ipHVMs?
 * ipHVMs stands for Intel Port Horo-Vault Multi-Sig. It is a multi-signature
 * contract with a time-lock feature, designed to secure your assets over time.
 * Ideal for savings, ensuring your funds remain protected even when unexpected
 * expenses arise, without disrupting financial management.
 *
 * 1. Creating Your ipHVMs Multi-Sig Contract:
 *    - Input four Ethereum personal wallet addresses in the [create] 
 *      IPHVMSalPORT contract.
 *    - Each address must be an EOA (Externally Owned Account) with a private 
 *      key or seed phrase.
 *    - Do not use a contract address, as compatibility is not guaranteed.
 *
 * 2. Deploying the Contract:
 *    - After entering the four owner addresses, initiate the transaction.
 *    - This will generate your ipHVMs contract.
 *    - Losing access to any owner wallets may result in loss of control over
 *      your ipHVMs contract.
 *
 * 3. Deployment Considerations:
 *    - Ensure the contract is deployed on the correct blockchain network.
 *    - The ipHVMs contract address is unique to a single chain.
 *    - Deploying on a different chain will generate a different address.
 *    - Always verify the network before interacting with the contract.
 *
 * Time-Lock Feature:
 *    - Is time-lock mandatory? No!
 *    - The ipHVMs contract functions as a standard multi-signature wallet.
 *    - The time-lock feature is optional and available for enhanced security. <3
 *
 *
 * Use at your own risk. We do not have the capability to recover funds from  
 * your ipHVMs contract, as there is no backdoor implemented in any ipHVMs  
 * contract. Ensure that you use a wallet address with a private key that you  
 * fully control.  
 *  
 * We cannot guarantee full functionality if a contract address is used.
