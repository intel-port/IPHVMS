Introducing ipHVMs
Intel Port Horo-Vault Multi-Signature [ipHVMs] contract is designed and built by the Intel Port Contract Security [IPCS] division, which operates under the Intel Port Foundation. This multi-sig contract includes a time-lock feature and is uniquely structured. Unlike other multi-sig contracts, ipHVMs ensures that withdrawal requests are only sent back to one of the owners, providing additional security by directing funds exclusively to a designated owner during the withdrawal process.
