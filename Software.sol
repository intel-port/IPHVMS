 * Intel Port Contract Security Division operates under the Intel Port  
 * Foundation. The software/code developed by Intel Port Contract Security  
 * is an integral part of the Intel Port project.  
 *  
 * This contract is intended for personal use—proceed at your own risk, as we  
 * do not have control over the deployed contract. The contract is fully  
 * open-source and has been tested under various conditions.  
 *  
 * There are no components within this contract that can access or steal your  
 * funds. We ensure that every contract we develop remains entirely outside  
 * our control post-deployment.
